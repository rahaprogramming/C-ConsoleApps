The manager of a football stadium wants you to write a program that
calculates the total ticket sales after each game. There are four types of
tickets—box, sideline, premium, and general admission. After each game,
data is stored in a file in the following form:
ticketPrice numberOfTicketsSold
...
Sample data are shown below:
250 5750
100 28000
50  35750
25  18750
The first line indicates that the ticket price is $250 and that 5750 tickets were
sold at that price. Output the number of tickets sold and the total sale
amount. Format your output with two decimal places.
